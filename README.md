## Repository Description

Terraform **example** module for a Google Cloud Platform Kubernetes engine cluster.

üí° *We do not recommend consuming this module like you might a [public module](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules). Its purpose is to be a baseline, something you can fork, potentially maintain, and modify to fit your organization's needs. Using public modules vs. writing your own has various [drivers and trade-offs](https://docs.osinfra.io/fundamentals/architecture-decision-records/adr-0003) that your organization should evaluate.*

## üî© Usage

You can check the [test/fixtures](test/fixtures/) directory for example configurations. These fixtures set up the system for testing by providing all the necessary initial code, thus creating good examples on which to base your configurations.

Google project services must be enabled before using this module. As a best practice, these should be defined in the [terraform-google-project](https://github.com/osinfra-io/terraform-google-project) module. The following services are required:

- `container.googleapis.com`
- `cloudkms.googleapis.com`
- `cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com`
- `gkehub.googleapis.com` (Only needed if project is a GKE Fleet host project)
- `multiclusteringress.googleapis.com` (Only needed if project is a GKE Fleet host project)
- `multiclusterservicediscovery.googleapis.com`
- `trafficdirector.googleapis.com`

> NOTE: The autoscaling profile feature requires the `google-beta` provider.
> Include this provider in your root module required_providers block if you use GitHub Dependabot.

Here is an example of a basic configuration; these would be in different `main.tf` files running separately in their own workflows. For example, the global configuration would run first  and then the regional configuration followed by the onboarding configurations.

### Fleet Host

`global/main.tf`:

```hcl
module "kubernetes-engine" {
  source = "github.com/osinfra-io/terraform-google-kubernetes-engine//global?ref=v0.0.0"

  project_id               = "example-project"
}
```

`regional/main.tf`:

```hcl
module "kubernetes-engine" {
  source = "github.com/osinfra-io/terraform-google-kubernetes-engine//regional?ref=v0.0.0"

  cost_center                    = "x000"
  cluster_prefix                 = "example-fleet-host-cluster"
  cluster_secondary_range_name   = "example-k8s-pods-us-east1"
  enable_gke_hub_host          = true

  gke_hub_memberships = {
    "example-member-us-east1" = {
      cluster_id = "projects/example-member-project/locations/us-east1/clusters/example-fleet-member-us-east4"
    }
  }

  network                        = "example-vpc"

  node_pools = {
    standard-pool = {
      machine_type = "g1-small"
    }
  }

  master_ipv4_cidr_block         = "10.61.224.0/28"
  project_id                     = "example-fleet-host-project"
  region                         = "us-east1"
  services_secondary_range_name  = "example-k8s-services-us-east1"
  subnet                         = "example-subnet-us-east1"
  vpc_host_project_id            = "example-vpc-host-project"
}
```

### Fleet Member

`global/main.tf`:

```hcl
module "kubernetes-engine" {
  source = "github.com/osinfra-io/terraform-google-kubernetes-engine//global?ref=v0.0.0"

  gke_fleet_host_project_id = "example-fleet-host-project"
  project_id                = "example-fleet-member-project"
}
```

`regional/main.tf`:

```hcl
module "kubernetes-engine" {
  source = "github.com/osinfra-io/terraform-google-kubernetes-engine//regional?ref=v0.0.0"

  cost_center                    = "x000"
  cluster_prefix                 = "example-fleet-member-cluster"
  cluster_secondary_range_name   = "example-k8s-pods-us-east4"
  network                        = "example-vpc"

  node_pools = {
    standard-pool = {
      machine_type = "g1-small"
    }
  }

  master_ipv4_cidr_block         = "10.61.224.16/28"
  project_id                     = "example-fleet-member-project"
  region                         = "us-east4"
  services_secondary_range_name  = "example-k8s-services-us-east4"
  subnet                         = "example-subnet-us-east4"
  vpc_host_project_id            = "example-vpc-host-project"
}
```

### Onboarding

`global/onboarding/main.tf`:

```hcl
module "team_a" {
  source  = "github.com/osinfra-io/terraform-google-kubernetes-engine//global/onboarding?ref=v0.0.0"

  namespace_admin = "team-a"

  namespaces = [
    "team-a-namespace-a",
    "team-a-namespace-b"
  ]

  project_id = "example-project"
}
```

`regional/onboarding/main.tf`:

```hcl
module "team_a" {
  source  = "github.com/osinfra-io/terraform-google-kubernetes-engine//regional/onboarding?ref=v0.0.0"

  namespace_admin = "team-a"

  namespaces = {
    team-a-namespace-a = {
      istio_injection = enabled
    }

    team-a-namespace-b = {}
  }

  project_id = "example-project"
}
```

Our focus is on the core fundamental practice of platform engineering, Infrastructure as Code.

>Open Source Infrastructure (as Code) is a development model for infrastructure that focuses on open collaboration and applying relative lessons learned from software development practices that organizations can use internally at scale. - [Open Source Infrastructure (as Code)](https://www.osinfra.io)

To avoid slowing down stream-aligned teams, we want to open up the possibility for contributions. The Open Source Infrastructure (as Code) model allows team members external to the platform team to contribute with only a slight increase in cognitive load. This section is for developers who want to contribute to this repository, describing the tools used, the skills, and the knowledge required, along with Terraform documentation.

See the documentation for setting up a local development environment [here](https://docs.osinfra.io/fundamentals/development-setup).
